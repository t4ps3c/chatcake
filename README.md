# ChatCake

This code uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 language model to create a chatbot that can answer user questions and engage in conversation. 

## Prerequisites

To use this code, you need to have an OpenAI API key. You can obtain an API key by signing up for OpenAI's GPT-3 beta program. Once you have an API key, replace "YOUR_API_KEY" in the code with your actual API key.

## How to use

To use the chatbot, run the code in a Python environment. You will be prompted to enter a message. Type your message and press enter. The chatbot will respond with an answer or a continuation of the conversation. You can exit the program by typing "exit" or "quit" when prompted for input.

## Important note

This code uses the GPT-3.5 Turbo model, which is a powerful language model that is capable of generating human-like text. However, it is important to use this model responsibly and ethically. OpenAI provides guidelines on responsible use of their technology that you should review and follow.
